# Graphics Calculator

This is a simple graphics calculator in Java with the following functionalities:

- Check the root of a graph
- Check if the graph is reflexive, symmetric, transitive or antisymmetric
- Check if the graph is considered a equivalence relation. If so, prints the equivalence classes
- Breadth-first search, both iterative and recursive
- Depth-first search, both iterative and recursive
